# Math Magik QProp

This project is developing a *Python* version of Mark Drela's **qprop**
{cite}`drela2007` program originally written in Fortran. Since Python is much
more approachable, I decided to work through the program logic, and recreate
most of the code using modern *Pythin* tools. FOr reference, the original
Fortran code is included here. That code can be compiled using *GNU*
**gfortran**. I used that code to validate the *Python* implementation.

I am not recreating the exact file format of the priginal code. Instead, the
*Python* application uses a simpler input format, more common in today's
development world.

This project is part of the *Math Magik* project I started tpo provide *Python*
tools to model airplane builders, especially those lfying indoor rubber-powerd
airplanes. I hope this also proves useful to other folks seeking to design
better propellers for their applications.
